       "\"deneme3.pdfBehavioral  Risk  Factor Surveillance  System OVERVIEW: BRFSS  2019 July 26, 2019 Background  The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project  between  all  of the states in  the United States (US) and participating US territories  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . The BRFSS  is administered and supported by CDC's  Population Health  Surveillance Branch,  under the Division  of Population Health at the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  The  BRFSS  is a system of  ongoing health -related telephone surveys  designed to collect data on  health -related risk behaviors,  chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services  from the  noninstitutionalized  adult population  ( 18 years ) residing  in the United States.   The BRFSS was initiated in 1984, with 15 state s collecting surveillance data on risk behaviors through monthly  telephone interviews. Over time, the number of states participating in the survey increased ; BRFSS now collects  data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and  participating  US  territories.  During  2019 , All 50 states, the District of Columbia,  Guam,  and Puerto Rico  collect ed  BRFSS  data . In this document, the term  state is used to refer to all areas participating in  the BRFSS , including the District of Columbia, Guam,  and  the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  New Jersey was unable to collect enough BRFSS data in 2019 to meet the  minimum requirements for inclusion in the 2019 annual aggregate data set.  BRFSS  objective is to collect uniform state -specific data on  health  risk behaviors , chronic diseases and  conditions, access to health  care, and use of preventive health services related to the leading causes of  death and disability  in the United States . Factors assessed by the BRFSS  in 2019 included health  status, healthy  days /health -related  quality of  life, health  care  access , exercise, inadequate sleep, c hronic  health  conditions , oral health, tobacco use, e -cigarettes, a lcohol consumption , immunization, falls, seat belt use,   drinking and driving, breast - and cervical cancer screening, prostate cancer screening, colorectal cancer  screening , and  HIV/AIDS knowledge . Since 2011,  the BRFSS  has  been  conduct ing both landline  telephone - and cell ular tele phone-based  surveys.  All the responses were self -reported; proxy interviews are not conducted  by the BRFSS.  In conducting  the landline telephone  survey , interviewers collect d ata from a randomly selected  adult in a  household . In conducting the cellular telephone  survey, interviewers collect  data  from adults  answering the cellular telephones  residing in a private residence or college housing.  Beginning in 2014, all  adults contacted through their  cellular telephone  were eligible , regardless of their landline phone use (i.e.,  complete overlap).   The  BRFSS field operations are managed by state health departments that follow  protocols adopted by the  states , with technical assistance provided by  CDC . State  health departments  collaborate during survey  developme nt and conduct t he intervie ws themselve s or use contractors. Th e data are transmitted to CDC for  editing, processing, weighting, and analysis. An edite d and weighted dat a file is provided to each participating  state health department for each year of  data collection, and summary reports of state-spec ific data are prepared  by CDC. S tate healt h departments us e the BRFS S data f or a variety of purposes, including identifying  demographic variations i n health-related behaviors ; designing, implementing, and eva luating public health  programs ; addressing emergent and critical health issues ; proposing legislation for health initiatives ; and  measuring progress toward sta te health objectives. 1 For spec ific examples of how state  officials use t he finalized  BRFSS data sets, please refer to the  appropriate state information on the BRFSS website.   Health characteristics estimated from the BRFSS pertain to the noninstitutionalized adult  populationaged 18 years or olderwho reside in the United States.  In 2019, an optional module was included to provide a measure for several childhood health and wellness indicators, including asthma  prevalence for people aged 17 years or younger. BRFSS respondents are identified through telephone-based methods.  In 2011, a new weighting methodology called iterative proportional fitt   4 replaced the post-stratification method to weight BRFSS data. Raking allows incorporation of cellular  telephone survey data and permits the introduction of additional demographic  characteristics (e.g., education level, marital status, home  renter/owner) in addition to age-race/ethnicity-gender that improves the degree  and extent to which the BRFSS sample properly reflects the socio-demographic make-up of  individual state. The  2019 BRFSS raking method includes categories of age by gender, detailed race  and ethnicity groups, education levels, marital status, regions  within states, gender by race and ethnicity, telephone  source, renter or owner status, and age groups by race and ethnicity. In 2019, 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico collected samples of interviews conducted by landline and cellular telephone.  The BRFSS Design The BRFSS Questionnaire Each year, the statesrepresented by their BRFSS coordinators and CDCagree on the content of  the questionnaire. The BRFSS questionnaire consists of a core component, optional modules, and state-added  questions . Many questions are  taken from established nationa l surveys, such as the National Health Interview  Survey or the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This practice  allows the BRFSS to take  advantage  of questions that have  been tested a nd allows states to compare  their data with those  from other surveys. Any new questions that states, federal agencies, or other entities propose  as additions t o the BRFSS  must go through cognitive testing and field testing before  they can bec ome part of the BRFSS questionnaire . In  addition, a majority vote of  all state representatives is  required before  questions are  adopted. The BRFSS  guidelinesagreed upon by the state representatives and CDC specify that all states ask the  core  component  questions without modification. The y may choose to add any, all, or none  of the optional modules and may add  questions of their choosi ng as state-added questions.   The questionnaire  has three  parts: 1.Core  component:  A standard set of questi ons that all  states use. Core  content includes queries about current health-related perceptions, condit ions, and behaviors (e.g., health status, healt h care access, alcohol  consumption, tobacco use , fruits and vegetable  consumptions, HIV/AIDS risks), as well  as demographic  questions. The  core component includes the  annual core comprising questions asked each year a nd rotating core  questi ons that are  included in even- and odd numbered years.   2.Option al BRFSS modules:  These  are  sets of questions on specific  topics (e.g., pre-diabetes, diabetes, sugar- sweetene d beverages, excess sun exposure , caregiving, shingles, cancer survivorship) that states elect to use  on their questionnaire s. Generally, CDC programs submi t module  questions a nd the states vote to adop t final  questions  that can be  included as optional modules. For more  information, please see  the questionnaire  section  of the BRFSS website.   3.State-added questions: Individual states develop or acquire these  questions and add them to their BRFSSquestionnaires. CDC does not edit, evaluate, or track   these questions.  The BRFSS supporte d 23 modules in 2019, but states limit ed modules a nd state-added questions to only the  most useful for  their state program purposes, in order to keep surveys at a reasonable length . Because  different  states have  different needs, there  is wide variati on between states in terms of question totals each year. The  BRFSS  implements a new questionnaire in January and usuall y does not  change  it significantly for the rest of  the year. The  flexibility of state-added questions, howeve r, does permit additions, changes, and deletions at any  time during the  year.   The 2019 list of  optional modules  used on both the  landline telephone a nd cellular  telephone surveys is  availa ble on the BRFSS w ebsite. In order to allow for a  wider range of questions in optional modules, combined  landline telephone  and cellular  telephone data for 2019 include up to three split versions of the  questionnaire. A  split version i s used when a subset of  telephone numbers for  data  collection still followed the state  sample   -added  questions may have been different from other  split -version questionnai res. For additional information on split  version questionnaires , see the  2019 module data appendix table , published with this yearly release.   Annual Questionnaire Development  The g overnance of the BRFSS includes a representative body of state health officials, elected by region.  During  the year, t he State BRFSS Coordinators Working Group meets with   management .  Before the beginning of the calendar year , CDC  provi des states with the text of the core component and the  optional modules  that the BRFSS  will  support in the coming year. States select their optional modules and  ready  any  state-added questions  they plan to use . Each state then constructs its  own  questionna ire. The order of the  questioning is always the same interviewers  ask questions from  the core component  first , then they ask  any  questions from the  optional modules , and  the state -added questions. This content order  ensures comparability  across states and follows  the BRFSS  guidelines. Generally, the only changes  that the standard protocol allows  are limited insertions of state -added questions on topics related to core questions . CDC  and state partners must  agree to th ese  exceptions . In some cases,  however,  states have not been able to follow all set guidelines. Users  should refer to  the yearly  Comparability of Data document , which  lists the k nown deviations . Once  each  state finalizes its  questionnaire content consistin g of the core  questionnaire , optional  modules, and  state-added questions the state prepares  a hard  copy or electronic version of the instrument  and sends it  to CDC . States use t he  questionnaire  without changes for one calendar year , and  CDC  archives a copy on the  BRFSS  website.  If a significant portion of  any  state  population does not speak English, states have the option  of translating the questionnaire into other languages.  Currently , CDC  provides a Spanish version of the core  questionnaire and optional modules.  Specific wording of the Spanish version of the questionnaire may be  adapted by the states to fit the needs of th eir Hispanic populations.   Sample Description  In a telephone survey such as the BRFSS, a sample record is one telephone number in the list of all telephone  numbers  the system randomly  select s for dialing. To meet the BRFSS standard for the participating states'  sample designs,  one must be able to just ify sample records as a probability sample of all households with  telephones in the state. All participating areas met this criterion in  2018. Fifty -one projects used a  disproportionate stratified sample (DSS) design  for their landline samples . Guam  and  Puerto Rico  used a simple  random -sample design.   In the type of DSS design  that states  most commonly use d in the BRFSS  landline telephone  sampling , the BRFSS divides  telephone numbers into two groups, or strata, which  are  sample d separately . The high -density  and medium -density strata contain telephone numbers that  are  expect ed to belong mostly to households . Whether a telephone number goes into the high -density or medi um-density stratum is determined by the number  of listed household numbers in its hundred block , or  set of  100 telephone numbers with the same area code,  prefix, and first  2 digits of the suffix and all possible combinations of the last  2 digits.  BRFSS put s numbers  from hundred blocks with  1 or more listed household numbers (1+ blocks, or banks)  in either the high -density  stratum (listed 1+ blocks) or medium -density stratum (unlisted 1 + blocks).  The  BRFSS samples t he two strata  to obtain a probability sam ple of all households with telephones.   Cellular telephone  sampling frames are  commercially  available , and  the system can call  random samples of  cellular telephone  numbers,  but doing so requires  specific protocols . The  basis of the  2019 BRFSS  sampling  frame  is the Telecordia database of telephone exchanges (e.g., 617 -492-000 0 to 617-492-9999) and 1,000 banks  (e.g., 617 -492-0000 to 617 -492-0999).  The vendor  uses dedicated cellular 1,000 banks, sorted on the basis of  area code and exchange within  a state.  The  BRFSS forms a n interval Kby dividing the population count of  telephone numbers in the frame Nby the desired sample size  n. The  BRFSS divides t he frame of  telephone numbers into n intervals of size K telephone numbers. From each interval,  the  BRFSS draws  one 10 -digit telephone number at random.   The target population  (aged 18 years and older)  for cell ular tele phone samples in  2019 consists of pe ople residing in a private residence or college housing  who have a  working  cellular telephone .  In  the sample design , state s begin with  a single stratum . To provide adequate sample sizes for smaller  geographically defined populations of interest,  however,  many states sample disproportionately from strata  that correspond to sub -state  regions.  In  2019, the  47 states with geographic strat ification  were  Alabama, Alaska,  Arizona, Arkansas, California, C olorado, Connecticut, Delaware , Florida,  Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,  Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,  Louisiana,  Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North  Carolina,  North Dakota,  Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,  Tennessee, Texas, Utah,  Vermont,  Virginia, Washington,  and  Wisconsin.  As a precaution to  protect the  confidential responses provided by the  respondent , specific variables  (such as  sub-state  geographic  identifiers,  detailed race  or e thnicity , and  older than 80 years of age ) in a given year  are removed . State health departments may directly collect d ata fr om their states or they may use a contractor . In 2019, seven  state health departments collected their data in -house  and  the remainder  contracted with other data collectors.  In  2019, the CDC  provided samples purchased from  Marketing Systems Group, Inc. ( MSG ) to all 53 states  and  territories.   Data  Collection  Interviewing Procedures  In  2019, 53 states  or territories  used  Computer -Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) systems . CDC  supports CATI programming using the Ci3 WinCATI software package . This support includes programming the core  and module questions for data collectors, providing questionnaire scripting of state -added questions for states  requiring such assistance, and contracting with a Ci3 consultant to assist states. Following guidelin es provided  by the BRFSS , state health personnel or contractors conduct interviews. The core portion of the questionnaire  lasts an average of 1 7 minutes. Interview time for modules and state -added questions is dependent upon the  number of questions used, b ut generally , they add  5 to 10 minutes  to the interview . Interviewer retention is very high among states that conduct the survey in -house. The state coordinator or  interviewer supervisor conduct s repeated  training  specific to the BRFSS.  Contractors typical ly use interviewers  who have experience conducting telephone surveys, but these interviewers are given additional training on the  BRFSS questionnaire and procedures before they are approved to work on  the BRFSS . The  BRFSS protocols require  evaluation of  interviewer performance.  During  2019, all BRFSS surveillance sites  had the capability to monitor their interviewers.  Interviewer -monitoring systems vary  from listening to the  interviewer only at an on -site location to listening to both the in terviewer and respondent at remote location s. Some states also use v erification callbacks  in addition to  direct monitoring. Contractors typically conducted  systematic monitoring  of each interviewer a certain amount of time each month. All states had the ca pability to  tabulate disposition code frequencies by interviewer. These data were the primary means for quantifying  interviewer performance.   States conducted t elephone interview s during each calendar month . They  made calls  7 days per week, during  both daytime and evening hours.  They followed s tandard  BRFSS  procedures for rotation of calls over days of  the week and time of day. Detailed information on interview response rates  is available  in the BRFSS  2019 Summary Data Quality Report.  Data Processing  Preparing for Data Collection and Data Processing   Data processing is an integral part of any survey. Because  states collect  and submit  data to  CDC  each month,  the BRFSS perform s routine data  processing tasks on an ongoing basis . Once  the final version of the new  questionnaire becomes available each year,  CDC  staff take steps to prepare for the next cycles of data  collection . These steps  include developing edit specifications, programming porti ons of the Ci3 WinCATI  software, programming the  editing s oftware, and producing telephone sample estimates  as requested by  states  and ordering the sample from the contract vendor . CDC  produces a  Ci3 WinCATI data entry module for each  state that  requests i t. CDC  staff also must incorporate s kip patterns, together with some consistency edits, and  response -code range checks into the CATI system. These edits and skip patterns serve to reduce interviewer,  data entry, and skip errors.  Developers prepare d ata conversion tables  that help processors  read the survey data  from the entry module, call information from the sample tracking module, and combin e information into the  final format for th at data year . CDC  also creates and distributes a Windows -based edit ing program that can  perform data validations on  files with  proper  survey result  format s. This program  helps users with  output lists of  errors or warn s users about  conditions  of concern that  may exist  in the data.   CDC  begins to process data for the survey  year as soon as states  (or their contractors ) begin submitting data to  the data management mailbox . Data processin g continues throughout the survey year . CDC  receives and tracks  monthly data submissions from the states. Once  data are received  from  a state , CDC  staff run  editing programs  and cumulative data quality checks  and note a ny problems in the file s. A CDC  programmer works  with each  state until  any  problems are  optimally  resolved.  CDC  staff  generate  data quality reports  and share them with  state coordinators, who review the reports and discuss any potential problems. Once  CDC  receives  and validates  the entire year of data for a state,  processors run  several year -end programs  on the data. These programs  perform some additi onal, limited data cleanup and fixes specific to  each  state and data year and produce reports  that identify potential analytic problems with the data set.  Once this step is completed , data are ready for  assigning weights and adding  calculated  variables.  Calculated variables are created for the benefit of users and  can be noted in the data set by the leading underscore in the variable name.  The following  calculated  variables  are examples of results from this procedure:    _RFSMOK3   _TOTINDA    _HCVU651 .  _AGE80   _FLUSHOT7   For more information, see the  Calculated Variables and Risk Factors in Data Files  document . Several  variables from the data file  are used  to create these variables in a  process  that varies in complexity . Some  are  based only on combined codes, while others require sorting and combining of  particular  codes from multiple  variables.   Almost every variable derived from the BRFSS interview has a code category labeled  refused  and assigned  values of  9, 99, or 999. Thes e values may also  be used to  represent missing responses. Missing responses may  be due to  non-interviews (a non -interview response results when an interview  ends  prior to this question and an  interviewer codes the remaining responses as refused) and  missing responses due to skip patterns in the  questionnaire . This code, however,  may capture some questions that were supposed to  have  answer s, but for  some rea son do not have them, and appeare d as a blank or  another symbol. Combi ning these types of  responses into a  single code requires vigilance on the part of data file  users who wish to separate (1) results of respondents  who did not rece ive a particular questi on and (2) results from responde nts who, afte r receiving the question,  gave  an unclea r answer or refused to answer it.  Weighting the Data  The BRFSS  is designed to obtain sample  information on the population of interest i.e., the  adult US population residing in different state s. Data weighting helps make  sample  data more  representative of the  population from  which the data were collec ted. BRFSS  data weights incorporat e the design of BRFSS survey  and characteristics of th e population. BRFSS weighting methodology comprises 1)  design factors or  design weight, and 2)  some form  of demographic  adjustment  of the population by iterative  proportional fitting or  raking.  The design weight  accounts for the probability of selection and adjusts for  nonresponse bias and non-coverage  errors. Design weights are  calculated using the  weight of each geographic stratum  (_STRWT), the number  of phones within a  household (NUMPHON2), and the  number of adult s age d 18 years and older in the  respo  . For cellphone  respondents, both NUMPHON2 and NUMADULT are  set to 1. The formula for the design weight is  Design Weight = _STRWT * (1/NUMPHON) * NUMADULT  The stratum weight (_STRWT)  accounts  for differences in the  probability of selection among strata  (subsets of area code o r prefix combinations). It is the inverse of the  sampling fraction of  each stratum. There is rare ly a complete correspondence  between stra ta (which are defined by subsets of area  code  or prefix combinations) and  regions which are defined by the boundaries of government entities.    BRFSS  calculates the  stratum  weight (_STRWT ) using the following items:  Number of available records  (NRECSTR ) and the number of records users select ( NRECSEL )within each  geographic strata and density strata. Geographic strata  (GEOSTR),  which may be the entire state or a geographic subset  (e.g., counties, census tracts ).Density strata  (_DENSTR ) indicating the density of the phone numbers for a given block of numbers as lis ted or not listed. Within eac h _GEOSTR*_DENSTR  combination, BRFSS  calculates the stratum  weight (_STRWT ) from the  average of the  NRECSTR  and the sum of all  sample records used to produce  the NRECSEL.  The stratum  weight is equal t o NRECSTR/NRECSEL.  The complete    selection in both the landline  and cell  phone sample  frame. A compositing factor wa s calculated f or dual users  in landline  and cell  phone sample frames. The  design weight is adjuste d by the compositing factor for the  records in the overlapping sample  frames and late r truncated based on quartiles. The  adjusted and truncated  design weight  was use d as the raking input weight.   BRFSS  uses iterative  proportional fitting, or raking , to adjust for demographic differences between  those persons who are  sampled  and the population that they represent. After combining landline and cellular  telephone data, BRFSS  performs raking by adjusting one or a  combination of demogra phic categorie s at a time in an  iterative  process until  a convergence  of a set value is reached. The  BRFSS  rakes the  design weight to 8 margins  (gender by age  group, race  or ethnicity, education, marital status, tenure, gender by race  or ethnicity, age  group by race or ethnicit y, and phone  ownership). If the state  had geographic regions, it  includes 4 additional margins  (region, region by age  group, region by gende r, an d region by race  or ethnicit y). If the state ha d at least 1 county  with 500 or more responde nts, the BRFSS  includes 4 additional margins (county, county by age  group, county by  gende r, and county by race  or ethnicity). BRFSS , therefore, use s the adjusted and truncated de sign weight for  raking and produce s _LLCPWT the  final weight assigned to each respondent.   The population estimates obtained for building the  target t otals for raking are  from similar  sources used in  previous  years . Intercensal population estimates were purchase d from Claritas, LLC at the  county-level for  age,  race or ethnicity, and gender. These  population estimates are  used as the population totals for  a state across all  margins. The 5-yea r year  American Community Survey PUMS data set (2014 2018) was used to obtain  estimates for  margins 3, 4, and 5 (education, marital status, tenure).  The  noninstitutionalized adults  were weighted by the person-level weights to generate the population estimates. The  percentages were  then used in  the raking margins. The  telephone  ownership estimates for  margin 8 were taken from the  state wireless estimate  percentages produced by the National Center  for Health Statistics (NCHS) and released in December of 2019.  Calculation of a Chil d Weight  The BRFSS  calculates the design weight for child weighting from the  stratum weight times the inverse of the number of  telephones in the household and then multiplies by the number of children:Child Design Weight = _STRWT * (1/NUMPHON ) * CHILDREN  CHIILDWT =  BRFSS rakes t he child design weig ht to 5 margins including age by gender, race  or  ethnicity, gender by race  or ethnicity, age by race  or ethnicity, and phone ownership.  _CLLCPWT  is the weight assigned for each child interview.
